Dear `r params[["name"]]`,

This is a test run for a mail merge using the [ R blastula package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/blastula-email.html). Apologies for this email spam; feel free to delete. Perhaps, if it is not too much trouble, an email to let me know that you've successfully received this would be much appreciated. Many thanks!     

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(
    data = .,
    mapping = aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = as.factor(cyl))
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Horse Power",
    y = "Mile Per Gallon",
    color = "Cylinders"
  )
```

Best regards,

`r params[["signoff"]]`
